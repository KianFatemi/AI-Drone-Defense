# AI Drone Defense (YOLOv5 + Flask + Docker)

This project is a lightweight AI-powered image inference system that detects potential drone threats using a YOLOv5 model deployed via a Flask API and containerized with Docker. Designed with edge deployment in mind, the system simulates a disconnected environment suitable for aerospace and defense applications.
